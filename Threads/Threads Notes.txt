concurrency
   do more then one process at the time.
concurrency can be achieved in two ways 

   i)multiprocessing (self contained excution environment,Multiasking)
   ii)Threading  
   
   JVM: Single process
    to achieve concurrency
 
MultiThreading
     ->light weight
     
by default  we start with Main thread.This thread have capability of creating new
thread

use :
 when multiple user involve
   eg:Video Games, Web Server - meet
 
 MultiThread:
     doing may task(JOB) at same time inside a single process
     
MultiThread can be achieved :
   1)Extending Thread class
   2)Implementinrg Runnable Interface
   
Thread class run()
    
    class start()// create the new thread
    
Exception :
  illegalThreadStateException  // if we start thread more then once
  illegalagumentException // if set the priority more then 10
  
 Thread Life Cycle:
        1)new  //creating new Thread
          start()
        2)Runnable // tell the JVM to start
          run()
        3)Running 
            
 End of Execution :                sleep(), wait()
  4)Dead                            4)Waiting
  
  object.getState()// return the state of thread
  
  Developer Moving a thread to Runnable
  JVM Moving Runnable to RUN
  
  ThreadScheduler:
     -> Decides Which Thread to be move from Runnable to Running
     -> it can set priority  1 to 10
     
     
     
default priority -5

obj.getName();
obj.setName();

obj.getId();
     
 
obj.yield() // currently excuting threads giving chance to other thread.which have same priority. it happens in running state


join()
  if the threads want to wait any other thread excution.
  
  
 Thread Interrupt method 
     sleep()
     yield()
     join()
  
  
  obj.interrupt();// interrupt the sleeping thread.
    eg:Wifi start off while no internet conncetion
