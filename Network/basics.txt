HOST :
    -> Host are anu device which sends or receive traffic
     eg: Laptop,Computer,Phone,Printer,Server,cloud Server..
     
     
   IP Address[0-255]: IP address is the identity of each host.
     -we need the IP address to send and recive packet on the network.
     -represented as Four octets
     
   packetTransfer : 
      Source <-> Destination
      
  Browser looks up IP address for teh domain(DNS).
  Browser initiates TCO connection with the server
  Browsr sends the HTTP request with the server
  
  
  Transmission Mode :
   mean=Transferring data between two device
    ->Simplex
    ->Half-Duplex,
    ->Full-Duplex.
  Simplex:
     unidirectional communication.
     only one of the two can send the data.
     eg:keyboard
   Half-Duplex
     Both transmit and recive but not at the same time.
     eg:Walki-talkie
   Full-Duplex
     Both station can transmit ans receive simultanously.
 
 
 
Subnetting :
Taking a network and dividing it into sub-networks. 

CIDR :classless Inter Domain Routing
/nework



OSI Layer :
   Purpose of networking allow two host to share data with one another
   
   Host must follow a set of rules:(& Layers)
       7)Application
       6)Presentation
       5)Session 
       4)Transport
       3)Network
       2)Data Link
       1)Physical
       
 Each layer serve a specfic function:
 
 
 1)Physical Layer :
      ->Computer data exits in the form of Bits (1's and 0's)
      ->This layer transport those bits between the host
      eg:twisted pair,coaixl,Fiber,wifi,repeaters,hub
       
 2)DataLink Layer:   [Frame]
      ->Interacts with the Wire(i.e, Physical layer)
      NIC-network Interface card , Wifi Access Cards(Hop to Hop delivery)
       
 MAC address : (48 bits , represented 6 hex digits)
   two part in it
    eg: DC-FB-48-7B-FB-9B
        - windows, : linux, .router
      1st 3 parts Manufacture ID
      2nd 3 parts NIC Serial ID
      
      Mac address used in switch,NIC
      
      The layer 2 takes data from 1st mac address to the next MAC adress.
      
      
  3)Network Layer : (end to end delivery)  [packet]IP
       addressing Scheme - IP address
       32 bits, 4 octets.
       
       Router 
   4)Transport layer  (Service to Service)   [Segments] 
     This layer make sure that right program recives right data.  
       addressing Scheme - Ports
       . 0-65535 -TCP  favors reliablility
       . 0-65535 -UDP  favours efficiency
       
       Servers listen for random to pre-defined Ports
       Clients select random port for each connection
       
     
     Session , Presentation, Application layer
     
   IN OSI sender side each layer encapsulate the message,
      reciver ride each layer will decapsulate the message.
  
  
  TCP 
  5.Application   data
  4.Trasport      TCP + data        [segment]
  3.Network       IP + TCP + data   [packet]
  2.Data Link     ETHERNET +  IP + TCP + data + ETHERNET [Frame]
  1.Physical    
     
     3Way handshake
       Syn
       Syn/ACK
       ACK
      
      TCP VS. UDP
       
    Application 
     webbrowser can directly interact with 
      Http , Smtp(mail transfer) 
    transport layer
     
 TCP Connection oriented. sequence checking, error checking with packet retransmission

      
 UDP Connectionless and unrealible protocal.Ihad limited error checking capapilities.
  It is simple protocal and used with minimum overhead.
  
  In UDP process can send the message without any reliablity
